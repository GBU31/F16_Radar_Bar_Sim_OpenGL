# 1 Bar
If the radar just moves left to right and back that is
considered 1 bar as it will scan just the single 4.9Â° slice of airspace. however, the radar can scan a larger area of vertical space if it moves down after a scan.

# 2 Bar

the radar scans left to right, moves down a few
degrees and scans back right to left. Because the radar antenna is pointing
lower the return scan looks at a different area of space than the first scan.

# 4 Bar

A 4 bar scan covers the most area but takes the longest to complete. A 1 bar
scan covers the least area but is the fastest; the 2 bar scan falls in between.
You trade off coverage for increased refresh rate of targets.
